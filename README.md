# AutoOrtho - Automatic orthophotos for X-Plane

Orthophoto satellite imagery is something that has been supported by X-Plane
for some time.  However, this would require a large commitment of storage
space and patience since imagery would need to be downloaded and prepared
ahead of time.

This project completely changes that with new techniques that download and cache orthos to your disk to insure a quick and light way to get sceneries wherever you are in the world. Just click run and enjoy the view!
