# AutoOrtho - Automatic orthophotos for X-Plane 11

Orthophoto satellite imagery is something that has been supported by X-Plane
for some time.  However, this would require a large commitment of storage
space and patience since imagery would need to be downloaded and prepared
ahead of time.

This project is an attempt, and working example, of an approach to only fetch
the imagery that we need on the fly.
